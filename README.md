# Welcome to PID

I started this repo when I first starting learning Calculus in high school, and so I took it upon myself to learn PID controls to better understand how **integrals** and **derivatives** are used in engineering.

## Resources

George Gillard's intro to PID was a great resource when I first started. It's short and concise and gets to the point. It is in the resources folder.

Here is his [website](https://georgegillard.com/) where I found the pdf.
